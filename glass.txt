ABSTRACT:
Human life is really tough to imagine without data as data is present at every mode of human life.
“Data is oxygen for today’s booming technology”
"About 75% of data is unstructured, coming from sources such as text, voice and video," 
Humans are  super talented creatures create by almighty. our lifes can be made more comfortable if we provide our intelligence to machines(ai)
. machine learning is the latest technology that is ruling the world. it is the phenomenon of provide mchines the power to analyse the data and make predictions like humans do.
machines are explicitly programmed to do such tasks.


Our project deals with classify the type of glass based on the chemical composition of the materials used in glass.
By predicting the category of the glass , we can deal with many situations like:
-> manufacturing good quality  of windows for automobiles
->making glasses resistant to damage by changing its composition
->avoid damage of windows to automobiles during accidents
->industrial usage of glass with reasonable cost
